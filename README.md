# BUSINESS PROBLEM:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* A game company gave its users gift money to purchase items in a game. Users buy various vehicles for their characters using these virtual coins. The game company did not specify a price for an item and allowed users to get whatever prices they wanted for that item. For example, for the item named shield, users will purchase this shield by paying the amounts they see fit. In other words, one user can pay with 30 virtual currencies and the other user with 45 virtual currencies. Therefore, users can purchase this product with the amounts they are willing to pay for themselves.
